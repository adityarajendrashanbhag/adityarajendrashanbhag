# Hi, I'm Aditya Rajendra Shanbhag👋

## About Me

I’m a Data Engineer with nearly 3 years of experience specializing in ETL development, data modeling and BI analytics in the retail sector. At Merkle DGS, I designed end-to-end data pipelines, built real-time backend APIs and developed semantic data layers for BI systems. Skilled in Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, Jenkins, REST APIs and AtScale, I’m currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University,focus on Data Engineering and Business Intelligence Analytics to automate and optimize data-driven workflows.

I'm always open to collaborating on exciting projects or contributing to open-source initiatives.

Let’s connect and explore opportunities to create impactful solutions together!
